// With that you can make anything possible without writing an API request.

import {ReactionCtx} from "../src/index.js";

// Now you need to create a new client simple by creating a new class.
const client = new Client()

// There are some event methods for our bot.
// The first method is onReady(), it basically called when the bot is successfully
// connected to our API and Websocket. (It has no arguments)
client.onReady(() => {
    // Maybe you can log something to the console.
    // In the future it may be expanded.
    console.log('Bot successfully connected')

// to a channel where the bot is invited.
// Here the only parameter is a message context. It's more than you think,
// everything is in that context that you need to develop a bot.
client.onMessage(handleOnMessage)

// The onReaction() method is called when someone reacts to a message
// with an emoji. (Unfortunately we don't provide an API to check that you already
// reacted to a message or not. You can solve this by using a database and storing all the
// message id-s that you have reacted to.)
// In this demo we will use a simple javascript list, but it's stateless, so when the bot
// stops it can make mistakes.
